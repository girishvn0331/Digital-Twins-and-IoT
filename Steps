-  Process simulated telemetry from an IoT Hub device
-  Here are the actions you'll complete to set up this device connection:
-  Create an IoT hub that will manage the simulated device
-  Connect the IoT hub to the appropriate Azure function by setting up an event subscription
-  Register the simulated device in IoT hub
-  Run the simulated device and generate telemetry
-  Query Azure Digital Twins to see the live results
-  Create an IoT Hub instance  (we already created)
